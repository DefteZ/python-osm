== DESCRIPTION

python-osm contains tools to read Open Street Map Data (*.osm).
It is splitted into several python classes:

src/pyosm.py: 
base class that contains the datamodel of osm. It parses the osm
file or data and puts every osm-object into pythonobjects.

src/multipolygon.py:
analyzes a multipolygon relation and provides a node-in-polygon check.
This class can export a polygon files for osmosis, too.

tools/relation2gpx.py:
Exports one or more relations into a gpx file. This tool can be used to
create gpx tracks for your gps-unit or to create maps with routes.

tools/osmhistory.py:
With this tool you can get an old versions of osm-objects at a given
timestamp. (experimental, use with care)
